# REACT---Phone-Catalog
DCSL GuideSmiths Code Challenge - REACT - Phone Catalog

This project works as a phone catalog using a REST API to control the functionality and a REACT app to show the catalog.
The REST API is developed using CORS so you need to install the following extions to your browser so that it doesn´t block the petition (Note that this will only solve the problem for local app developing):
- Moesif Origin & CORS Changer
- Cross Domain - CORS

The REST API works perfectly but the react app have some problems. It can´t display the list of phones because there are some errors when mapping the data. There is a simpler design of the react app in the react.zip that displays the phone catalog without errors but without any css. The rest of the functions are implemented in the /src/App.js file that appears in the repository.
