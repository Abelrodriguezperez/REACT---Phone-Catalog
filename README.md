# REACT---Phone-Catalog
DCSL GuideSmiths Code Challenge - REACT - Phone Catalog

This project works as a phone catalog using a REST API to control the functionality and a REACT app to show the catalog.
The REST API is developed using CORS so you need to install the following extions to your browser so that it doesnÂ´t block the petition (Note that this will only solve the problem for local app developing):
- Moesif Origin & CORS Changer
- Cross Domain - CORS
